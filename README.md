# Hackernews Prism

A clone of [Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) built with Prism, Rust and Rocket.

Built using the [Hackernews REST API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API).

Inspired by [hn.svelte.dev](https://github.com/sveltejs/hn.svelte.dev).

This project shows the main benefits of using Prism which no other framework / compiler has:

- Smallest bundle size
- Isomorphic Rust compilation
- JIT Hydration
